# gpwahlomat

An application to help voters see which political parties are the best fit to their beliefs.

This fork removes database use. No Postgres required.

# setup

1. Clone repository
2. `cd` to repository folder
3. <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
9. <code>python gpwahlomat/client.py run</code>

After doing this you will have a local database with the needed tables and the app can be reached at port 5000.

# setup windows

Not tested on Windows. Should just work the same way.
